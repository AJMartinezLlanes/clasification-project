# Classification Project
by AJ Martinez

## Plan

 - State project goals
 - State initial questions
 - Acquire data
 - Prepare Data
 - Create Functions
 - Set the data context
 - Answer questions 
 - Establish a baseline
 - Fit models
 - Recomendations
 - Next steps

## Data Dictionary


## Steps to reproduce

- Notebooks with code are in this repo 
- acquire.py with functions on how to acquire data
- prepare.py with functions to clean and prepare data
- Notebook with a walkthrough of the findings

## Project Goals

- Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

## Project Description

- Prepare a walk through notebook to help managers understand why are customers churning. 
- Find drivers of churns, find solutions and recomendations to lower the churning rate.

## Initial Questions

- What is Telco's churn rate?
- What are the top 3 features with the highest churn rate?
- What are the top 3 features with the lowest churn rate?
- What demographic has the highest churn rate?

## Deliberables
1. Readme(.md)
2. Final Report(.ipynb)
3. Acquire & Prepare Modules(.py)
4. Predictions(.csv)
5. 1+ non-final notebooks (.ipynb) created while working the project, containing exploration and modeling work
